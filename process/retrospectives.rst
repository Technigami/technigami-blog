Retrospectives
==============

As entrepreneurs we participate in regular retrospectives in order to continuously refine our practices to cut down waste and increase our efficiency of value production.

The Retrospective Process
=========================
For teams of 6 - 10 members, this entire process should take between 30 and 60 minutes. 
  * Identify (and record?) what practices worked well since the last retrospective.
  * Identify (and record?) what practices (or lack thereof) did not work since the last retrospective.
  * Decide what small incremental change to make.

Schedule
========

Thursday Evenings around 7:00
